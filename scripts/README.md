# Scripts

This folder contains utility and automation scripts for the Fortify project.

Currently, the main project automation is handled through npm scripts defined in `src/package.json`:

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Create production build  
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run code linting

Any additional build scripts, deployment automation, or development utilities would be placed here. This might include things like:

- Asset optimization scripts
- Database migration scripts  
- Automated testing workflows
- Deployment configuration files

For now, the standard Next.js npm scripts handle all our automation needs.
