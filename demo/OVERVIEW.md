## ðŸŽ¯ Project Name
**Fortify - Password Security Gamification Platform**

## ðŸš€ Summary

Users build their digital fortress by creating strong passwords, learning security best practices, and earning XP while progressing through different fort levels. The platform combines interactive lessons, achievement systems, and visual progression to make cybersecurity education fun and memorable.

## âœ¨ Key Features

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
With cybersecurity threats constantly growing, most people still use weak passwords and ignore basic security practices. Traditional security training is often boring and forgettable. I wanted to create something that would make learning about password security actually enjoyable - turning it into a game where users feel motivated to improve their security habits while having fun building their digital fortress.
